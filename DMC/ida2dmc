Attribute sta
        String (6)

        Description ( "station" )
        Detail {
                This is the common code-name of a seismic observatory.
                Generally only three or four characters are used.

Attribute chan
        String (8)

        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "channel" )
        Detail {
                This is an eight-character code, which, taken together
                with sta, jdate and time, uniquely identifies the source
                of the seismic data, including the geographic location,
                spatial orientation, sensor and subsequent data
                processing.

Attribute loccode
        String (2)
        Format ( "%-2s" )
        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "SEED location code" )
        Detail {
                This is a two-character code, which, is used to create
                the location to be used with the SEED version that requires
                location codes.

Attribute time
        Time (17)
        Format ( "%17.5f" )
        Null ( "-9999999999.99900" )
        Units ( "Seconds" )
        Description ( "epoch time" )
        Detail {
                Epochal time given as seconds and fractions of a second
                since hour 0 January 1, 1970, and stored in a double
                precision floating number.  Refers to the relation data
                object with which it is found.  E.g., in arrival - arrival
                time; in origin - origin time; in wfdisc, - start time of
                data.  Where date of historical events is known, time is
                set to the start time of that date; where the date of
                contemporary arrival measurements is known but no time is
                given, then the time attribute is set to the NA value.
                The double-precision floating point number allows 15
                decimal digits.  At 1 millisecond accuracy this is a range
                of 3 years.  Where time is unknown, or prior to Feb.  10,
                1653, set to the NA value.

Attribute endtime
        Time (17)
        Format ( "%17.5f" )
        Null ( "9999999999.99900" )
        Units ( "Epochal seconds" )
        Description ( "last valid time for data" )
        Detail {
                In wfdisc, this attribute is the time of the last sample
                in the waveform file.  Endtime is equivalent to
                time+(nsamp-1)/samprate.  In sensor, this is the last time
                the data in the record are valid.
